    <oval-def:description>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems: LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted cramfs filesystem. LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext2 filesystem. LMH reported an issue in the minix filesystem that allows local users with mount privileges to create a DoS (printk flood) by mounting a specially crafted corrupt filesystem. OpenVZ Linux kernel team reported an issue in the smbfs filesystem which can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (oops) during mount. Ilja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialised stack buffer. This could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel memory. Thomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash). A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed in a subsequent update. Florian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory. The PaX Team discovered a potential buffer overflow in the random number generator which may permit local users to cause a denial of service or gain additional privileges. This issue is not believed to effect default Debian installations where only root has sufficient privileges to exploit it. Adam Litke reported a potential local denial of service (oops) on powerpc platforms resulting from unchecked VMA expansion into address space reserved for hugetlb pages. Steve French reported that CIFS filesystems with CAP_UNIX enabled were not honoring a process umask, which may lead to unintentionally relaxed permissions. Wojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath_signal was not being reset properly under certain conditions, which may allow local users to gain privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries. Hugh Dickins discovered a potential local DoS (panic) in hugetlbfs. A misconversion of hugetlb_vmtruncate_list to prio_tree may allow local users to trigger a BUG_ON() call in exit_mmap. Alan Cox reported an issue in the aacraid driver that allows unprivileged local users to make ioctl calls which should be restricted to admin privileges. Wojciech Purczynski discovered a vulnerability that can be exploited by a local user to obtain superuser privileges on x86_64 systems. This resulted from improper clearing of the high bits of registers during ia32 system call emulation. This vulnerability is relevant to the Debian amd64 port as well as users of the i386 port who run the amd64 linux-image flavour. Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam devices. If the device is removed while a userspace application has it open, the driver will wait for userspace to close the device, resulting in a blocked USB subsystem. This issue is of low security impact as it requires the attacker to either have physical access to the system or to convince a user with local access to remove the device on their behalf. Venustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl handling, exploitable by a local user. ADLAB discovered a possible memory overrun in the ISDN subsystem that may permit a local user to overwrite kernel memory by issuing ioctls with unterminated data. Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to gain access to sensitive information. Cyrill Gorcunov reported a NULL pointer dereference in code specific to the CHRP PowerPC platforms. Local users could exploit this issue to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS). Nick Piggin of SuSE discovered a number of issues in subsystems which register a fault handler for memory mapped areas. This issue can be exploited by local users to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly execute arbitrary code. The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for compatibility with or to take advantage of this update: We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</oval-def:description>
