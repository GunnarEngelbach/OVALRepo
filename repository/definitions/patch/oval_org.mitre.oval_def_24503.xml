    <oval-def:description>Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
supporting FTP, Gopher, and HTTP data objects.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way Squid processed certain HTTPS
requests when the SSL Bump feature was enabled. A remote attacker could
send specially crafted requests that could cause Squid to crash.
(CVE-2014-0128)

Red Hat would like to thank the Squid project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Mathias Fischer and Fabian Hugelshofer from Open
Systems AG as the original reporters.

All squid users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing this
update, the squid service will be restarted automatically.</oval-def:description>
