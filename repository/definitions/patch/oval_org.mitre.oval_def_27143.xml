    <oval-def:description>kvm has been updated to fix issues in the embedded qemu:
    *
      CVE-2014-0223: An integer overflow flaw was found in the QEMU block
driver for QCOW version 1 disk images. A user able to alter the QEMU disk
image files loaded by a guest could have used this flaw to corrupt QEMU
process memory on the host, which could potentially have resulted in
arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges
      of the QEMU process.
    *
      CVE-2014-3461: A user able to alter the savevm data (either on the
disk or over the wire during migration) could have used this flaw to to
corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, which could have
potentially resulted in arbitrary code execution on the host with the
privileges of the QEMU process.
