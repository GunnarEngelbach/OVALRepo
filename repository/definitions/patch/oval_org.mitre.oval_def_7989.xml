    <oval-def:description>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat servlet and JSP engine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems: It was discovered that single quotes (') in cookies were treated as a delimiter, which could lead to an information leak. It was discovered that the character sequence \' in cookies was handled incorrectly, which could lead to an information leak. It was discovered that the host manager servlet performed insufficient input validation, which could lead to a cross-site scripting attack. It was discovered that the JULI logging component did not restrict its target path, resulting in potential denial of service through file overwrites. It was discovered that the WebDAV servlet is vulnerable to absolute path traversal. The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tomcat5.5. For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version 5.5.20-2etch1. For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon. We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat5.5 packages.</oval-def:description>
