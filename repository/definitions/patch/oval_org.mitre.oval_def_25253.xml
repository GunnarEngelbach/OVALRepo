    <oval-def:description>The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient,
and extensible web server.

A race condition flaw, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, was found in
the mod_status httpd module. A remote attacker able to access a status page
served by mod_status on a server using a threaded Multi-Processing Module
(MPM) could send a specially crafted request that would cause the httpd
child process to crash or, possibly, allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user. (CVE-2014-0226)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the mod_cache httpd module.
A malicious HTTP server could cause the httpd child process to crash when
the Apache HTTP Server was used as a forward proxy with caching.
(CVE-2013-4352)

A denial of service flaw was found in the mod_proxy httpd module. A remote
attacker could send a specially crafted request to a server configured as a
reverse proxy using a threaded Multi-Processing Modules (MPM) that would
cause the httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2014-0117)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_deflate module
handled request body decompression (configured via the "DEFLATE" input
filter). A remote attacker able to send a request whose body would be
decompressed could use this flaw to consume an excessive amount of system
memory and CPU on the target system. (CVE-2014-0118)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way httpd's mod_cgid module
executed CGI scripts that did not read data from the standard input.
A remote attacker could submit a specially crafted request that would cause
the httpd child process to hang indefinitely. (CVE-2014-0231)

All httpd users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.</oval-def:description>
