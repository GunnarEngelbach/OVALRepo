    <oval-def:description>Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
the development of security-enabled client and server applications.

It was found that the Malaysia-based Digicert Sdn. Bhd. subordinate
Certificate Authority (CA) issued HTTPS certificates with weak keys. This
update renders any HTTPS certificates signed by that CA as untrusted. This
covers all uses of the certificates, including SSL, S/MIME, and code
signing. Note: Digicert Sdn. Bhd. is not the same company as found at
digicert.com. (BZ#751366)

Note: This fix only applies to applications using the NSS Builtin Object
Token. It does not render the certificates untrusted for applications that
use the NSS library, but do not use the NSS Builtin Object Token.

This update also fixes the following bug on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5:

* When using mod_nss with the Apache HTTP Server, a bug in NSS on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 resulted in file descriptors leaking each time the
Apache HTTP Server was restarted with the "service httpd reload" command.
This could have prevented the Apache HTTP Server from functioning properly
if all available file descriptors were consumed. (BZ#743508)

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, these updated packages upgrade NSS to
version 3.12.10. As well, they upgrade NSPR (Netscape Portable Runtime) to
version 4.8.8 and nss-util to version 3.12.10 on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6, as required by the NSS update. (BZ#735972, BZ#736272,
BZ#735973)

All NSS users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct this
issue. After installing the update, applications using NSS must be
restarted for the changes to take effect. In addition, on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6, applications using NSPR and nss-util must also be
restarted.</oval-def:description>
