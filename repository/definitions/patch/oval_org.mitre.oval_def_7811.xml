    <oval-def:description>Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL database server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems: It was discovered that the privilege validation for the source table of CREATE TABLE LIKE statements was insufficiently enforced, which might lead to information disclosure. This is only exploitable by authenticated users. It was discovered that symbolic links were handled insecurely during the creation of tables with DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY statements, which might lead to denial of service by overwriting data. This is only exploitable by authenticated users. It was discovered that queries to data in a FEDERATED table can lead to a crash of the local database server, if the remote server returns information with less columns than expected, resulting in denial of service. The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain mysql-dfsg-5.0. For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version 5.0.32-7etch4. For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 5.0.51-1. We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0</oval-def:description>
