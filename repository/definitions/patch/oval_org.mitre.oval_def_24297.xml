    <oval-def:description>Samba is an open-source implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) or
Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which allows PC-compatible
machines to share files, printers, and other information.

It was found that certain Samba configurations did not enforce the password
lockout mechanism. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform
password guessing attacks on Samba user accounts. Note: this flaw only
affected Samba when deployed as a Primary Domain Controller.
(CVE-2013-4496)

A flaw was found in Samba's "smbcacls" command, which is used to set or get
ACLs on SMB file shares. Certain command line options of this command would
incorrectly remove an ACL previously applied on a file or a directory,
leaving the file or directory without the intended ACL. (CVE-2013-6442)

A flaw was found in the way the pam_winbind module handled configurations
that specified a non-existent group as required. An authenticated user
could possibly use this flaw to gain access to a service using pam_winbind
in its PAM configuration when group restriction was intended for access to
the service. (CVE-2012-6150)

Red Hat would like to thank the Samba project for reporting CVE-2013-4496
and CVE-2013-6442, and Sam Richardson for reporting CVE-2012-6150.
Upstream acknowledges Andrew Bartlett as the original reporter of
CVE-2013-4496, and Noel Power as the original reporter of CVE-2013-6442.

All users of Samba are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing this
update, the smb service will be restarted automatically.</oval-def:description>
