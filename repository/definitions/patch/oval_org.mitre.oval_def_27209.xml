    <oval-def:description>PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Server. PHP's fileinfo module provides functions used to identify a
particular file according to the type of data contained by the file.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the File Information (fileinfo)
extension processed certain Pascal strings. A remote attacker able to make
a PHP application using fileinfo convert a specially crafted Pascal string
provided by an image file could cause that application to crash.
(CVE-2014-3478)

Multiple flaws were found in the File Information (fileinfo) extension
regular expression rules for detecting various files. A remote attacker
could use either of these flaws to cause a PHP application using fileinfo
to consume an excessive amount of CPU. (CVE-2014-3538)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-1571 was incomplete; the File
Information (fileinfo) extension did not correctly parse certain Composite
Document Format (CDF) files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash
a PHP application using fileinfo via a specially crafted CDF file.
(CVE-2014-3587)

It was found that PHP's gd extension did not properly handle file names
with a null character. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
make a PHP application access unexpected files and bypass intended file
system access restrictions. (CVE-2014-5120)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the gdImageCreateFromXpm()
function of PHP's gd extension. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
crash a PHP application using gd via a specially crafted X PixMap (XPM)
file. (CVE-2014-2497)

Multiple buffer over-read flaws were found in the php_parserr() function of
PHP. A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly
use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as the PHP interpreter if a PHP
application used the dns_get_record() function to perform a DNS query.
(CVE-2014-3597)

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the way PHP handled certain Standard
PHP Library (SPL) Iterators and ArrayIterators. A malicious script author
could possibly use either of these flaws to disclose certain portions of
server memory. (CVE-2014-4670, CVE-2014-4698)

The CVE-2014-3478 issue was discovered by Francisco Alonso of Red Hat
Product Security, the CVE-2014-3538 issue was discovered by Jan KaluЕѕa of
the Red Hat Web Stack Team, and the CVE-2014-3597 issue was discovered by
David KutГЎlek of the Red Hat BaseOS QE.

All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
take effect.</oval-def:description>
