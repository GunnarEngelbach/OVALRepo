    <oval-def:description>TrouSerS is an implementation of the Trusted Computing Group's Software
Stack (TSS) specification. You can use TrouSerS to write applications that
make use of your TPM hardware. TPM hardware can create, store and use RSA
keys securely (without ever being exposed in memory), verify a platform's
software state using cryptographic hashes and more.

A flaw was found in the way tcsd, the daemon that manages Trusted Computing
resources, processed incoming TCP packets. A remote attacker could send a
specially crafted TCP packet that, when processed by tcsd, could cause the
daemon to crash. Note that by default tcsd accepts requests on localhost
only. (CVE-2012-0698)

Red Hat would like to thank Andrew Lutomirski for reporting this issue.

The trousers package has been upgraded to upstream version 0.3.13, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version,
including corrected internal symbol names to avoid collisions with other
applications, fixed memory leaks, added IPv6 support, fixed buffer handling
in tcsd, as well as changed the license to BSD. (BZ#633584, BZ#1074634)

All trousers users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues and add these enhancements.</oval-def:description>
