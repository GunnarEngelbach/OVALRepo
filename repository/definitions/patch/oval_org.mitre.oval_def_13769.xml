    <oval-def:description>The previous update caused a regression for apache2 in Debian 4.0 &amp;quot;etch&amp;quot;. Using mod_deflate together with mod_php could cause segfaults when a client aborts a connection. This update corrects this flaw. For reference the original advisory text is below. A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy module when it was used as a reverse proxy. A remote attacker could use this flaw to force a proxy process to consume large amounts of CPU time. This issue did not affect Debian 4.0 &amp;quot;etch&amp;quot;. A denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module. This module continued to compress large files until compression was complete, even if the network connection that requested the content was closed before compression completed. This would cause mod_deflate to consume large amounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large file. A similar flaw related to HEAD requests for compressed content was also fixed. The oldstable distribution, this problem has been fixed in version 2.2.3-4+etch10. The other distributions stable, testing and unstable were not affected by the regression. This advisory also provides updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which have been recompiled against the new apache2 packages. Updated packages for apache2-mpm-itk for the s390 architecture are not included yet. They will be released as soon as they become available. We recommend that you upgrade your apache2, apache2-mpm-itk package.</oval-def:description>
