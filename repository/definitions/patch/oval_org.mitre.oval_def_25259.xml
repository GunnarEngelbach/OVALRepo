    <oval-def:description>The libtasn1 library provides Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) parsing
and structures management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoding
and decoding functions.

It was discovered that the asn1_get_bit_der() function of the libtasn1
library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
asn1_read_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting these issues.

All libtasn1 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
linked to the libtasn1 library must be restarted.</oval-def:description>
