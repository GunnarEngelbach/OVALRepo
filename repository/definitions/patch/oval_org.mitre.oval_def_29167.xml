    <oval-def:description>An updated dnsmasq package that implements UDP source-port randomization
is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.
Dnsmasq is lightweight DNS forwarder and DHCP server. It is designed to
provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
The dnsmasq DNS resolver used a fixed source UDP port. This could have made
DNS spoofing attacks easier. dnsmasq has been updated to use random UDP
source ports, helping to make DNS spoofing attacks harder. (CVE-2008-1447)
All dnsmasq users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, that
upgrades dnsmasq to version 2.45, which resolves this issue.</oval-def:description>
